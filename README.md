# PriceComparatorSWProject
This project involves developing a front-end for a website that compares prices across various online supermarkets. Using web scraping or APIs, the backend gathers and normalizes real-time pricing data, storing it in a database for efficient retrieval. The front-end, built with modern web technologies, provides users with a seamless interface to search for products, view the best deals, and receive personalized alerts.
